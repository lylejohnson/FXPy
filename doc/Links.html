Obviously, FXPy wouldn't exist without <a href="http://www.cfdrc.com/FOX/fox.html">FOX</a>
or <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. I do some work on the Windows
port of FOX but its primary developer and architect is <a href="mailto:jvz@cfdrc.com">Jeroen
van der Zijp</a>.</li>

<li>
I use Dave Beazley's <a href="http://swig.sourceforge.net">SWIG</a> to
automatically generate most of FXPy.</li>

<li>
A lot of things which would have been difficult to figure out have been
previously figured out by Robin Dunn for <a href="http://alldunn.com/wxPython">wxPython</a>.
Studying his work in that project saved me a lot of time getting started
with FXPy. Please note that I don't consider FXPy to be in "competition"
with wxPython or any of the other GUI toolkits. I think each of them has
its own merits and design philosophies and you should choose the one that
works for you.</li>

<li>
<a href="mailto:Darren_Hiebert@XonTech.com">Darren Hiebert</a> has developed
an Eiffel language binding for FOX. You can read more about it <a href="http://darren.hiebert.com/EiffelFox">here</a>.</li>
